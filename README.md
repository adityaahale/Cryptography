# Cryptography
A Tool To Measure Cryptographic Algorithms

A. Pre-requistes to run this tool:
  1. pip install cryptography
  2. pip install numpy
  3. pip install pandas
  4. piip install matplotlib
  
B. How to run?
  1. Clone this repository or maintain same folder structure for Results. Create "Results" folder and a "Graphs" inside Results folder.
  2. Download the Data folder and keep it in same directory as of "perf_tool_crypto.py".
  3. Run perf_tool_crypto.py using VSCode or any other python IDE/Command line

C. Results
  1. Results are stored in result folder and graphs are stored in "Results\Graphs" folder.
  2. You can see the rime taken by each algorithm in nano seconds, micro seconds and seconds in UTC format in the terminal/console output.
  3. After it the graphs for each are shown one by one. Please close the current graph to see the next graph result. 
  4. The new file are generated in respective "Data" folder.
